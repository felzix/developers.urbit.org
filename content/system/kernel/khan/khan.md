Khan is the "control plane" and thread-runner vane. Its main purpose is to allow
external applications to run [threads](/reference/arvo/threads/overview) via a
Unix Socket and receive the result.

At this stage, Khan's external interface is still experimental, and there are
not yet proper libraries for other languages that can make use of it. Therefore,
these documents will only touch on Khan's internal interface.

Khan's internal interface lets you run threads via Khan rather than having to
poke [Spider](/reference/arvo/threads/reference) and subscribe for the result. This interface is simpler and more
ergonomic than Spider's, so is usually preferable.

There are currently three `task`s to run a thread: `%fard`, `%fyrd`, and `%lard`.
Only `%fard` is currently documented in
the [API Reference](/reference/arvo/khan/tasks) section, and a practical example
is given in the [Example](/reference/arvo/khan/example) section.
