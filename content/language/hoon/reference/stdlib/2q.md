## `+$axis`

Tree address

A Nock axis inside a noun. After the leading 1, in binary, a `1` signfies
right and `0` left.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  axis  @
```

#### Examples

```
> =axis `axis`7
> axis
7
> `@ub`axis
0b111

> =noun [[4 5] [6 14 15]]

> .*(noun [0 axis])
[14 15]
```

---

## `+$bean`

Boolean

`0`, `&`, or `%.y` are true, and `1`, `|`, and `%.n` are false.

Note 1 is false and 0 is true. This is sometimes referred to as "loobean".

#### Source

```hoon
+$  bean  ?
```

#### Examples

```
> *bean
%.y
```

```
> `bean`&
%.y
```

```
> `bean`|
%.n
```

---

## `+$flag`

Boolean

Same as [$bean](#bean).

#### Source

```hoon
+$  flag  ?
```

---

## `+$char`

Character

A single `@t` character.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  char  @t
```

#### Examples

```
> *char
''
```

```
> `char`'a'
'a'
```

---

## `+$cord`

UTF-8 text

One of Hoon's two string types (the other being `tape`). A cord is an
atom of UTF-8 text.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  cord  @t
```

#### Examples

```
> *cord
''

> `@ux`'foobar'
0x7261.626f.6f66

> `@t`97
'a'

> `@`'urbit'
499.984.265.845

> `@t`499.984.265.845
'urbit'
```

#### Discussion

Aura `@t` designates a Unicode atom, little-endian: the first character
in the text is the least-significant byte.

[`trip`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/4b#trip) converts from `cord` to `tape`, and [`crip`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/4b#crip) converts
from `tape` to `cord`.

---

## `+$byts`

bytes, LSB first

An atom `dat` with its byte-length specified in `wid`. This is to handle leading zeros that are typically ignored.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  byts  [wid=@ud dat=@]
```

#### Examples

```
> *byts
[wid=0 dat=0]
```

```
> =a `byts`[4 2]
> a
[wid=4 dat=2]

> `@ux`(rev 3 a)
0x200.0000
```

---

## `+$date`

Parsed date

A boolean designating AD or BC, a year atom, a month atom, and a `tarp`,
which is a day atom and a time.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  date  [[a=? y=@ud] m=@ud t=tarp]
```

#### Examples

```
> *date
[[a=%.y y=0] m=0 t=[d=0 h=0 m=0 s=0 f=~]]

> `date`(yore ~2014.6.6..21.09.15..0a16)
[[a=%.y y=2.014] m=6 t=[d=6 h=21 m=9 s=15 f=~[0xa16]]]

> now
~2018.5.25..17.55.15..9ad8
```

#### Discussion

See also: [`year`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/3c#year), [`yore`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/3c#yore)

---

+$  stud                    ::  standard name
          $@  mark=@tas     ::  auth=urbit
          $:  auth=@tas     ::  standards authority
              type=path     ::  standard label
          ==                ::
```

---

## `+$tang`

Bottom-first error

A list of [`tank`](#tank)s. It's for printing types and bottom-up printing of stack
traces.

#### Source

```hoon

[foo bar baz]
  ~
~
```

---

## `+$tank`

Formatted print tree

A `tank` is one of four cases:

- just a `cord`.
- `%leaf` is just a `tape`.
- `%palm` is a list of `tank` delimited by the strings in `p`, with back-steps at new lines.
- `%rose` is a list of `tank` delimited by the strings in `p` without back-steps at new lines.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  tank
  $~  leaf/~
  $@  cord
  $%  [%leaf p=tape]
      [%palm p=(qual tape tape tape tape) q=(list tank)]
      [%rose p=(trel tape tape tape) q=(list tank)]
  ==
```

#### Examples

```
> *tank
[%leaf p=""]
```

```
> ~(ram re 'foobar')
"foobar"
```

```
> ~(ram re leaf+"foo")
"foo"
```

```
> ~(ram re [%palm ["|" "(" "!" ")"] leaf+"foo" leaf+"bar" leaf+"baz" ~])
"(!foo|bar|baz)"
