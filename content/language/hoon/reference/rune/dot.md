Anything Nock can do, Hoon can do also. These runes are used for carrying out Nock operations in Hoon.

## `.^` "dotket"

Load from the Arvo namespace (scry) with a fake Nock instruction: Nock 12.

#### Syntax

Two arguments, with the second optionally split into an arbitrary number of
elements.

While this rune technically takes a fixed number of arguments, `q` is usually
split into at least two parts, and the tall form of this rune must be terminated
with a `==`. Note also that the `==` does not make the arguments into a list as
you might expect, so `q` must be explicitly null-terminated if its elements are
specified separately.

{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%dtkt p=spec q=hoon]
```

#### Produces

The noun `q`, cast to the type `p`.

#### Discussion

Nock has no `12` instruction! But the virtual Nock
used to run userspace code does. Nock `12` loads from a
typed immutable namespace defined by its virtual context.

Ordinarily a Hoon expression has access to no information but whatever can be found in the subject. The one exception is with the `.^` rune. It essentially allows you to request information from one of the Arvo vanes (modules).

`.^` checks that the type of the value retrieved from Arvo nests under `p`. `q` is a `path` which includes information about which vane is being queried, and what sort of information is requested.

In principle `.^` takes two subexpressions, but in practice `q` is often given in two parts: the first part includes the vane to be queried (e.g., `%a` for Ames, `%b` for Behn, `%c` for Clay, etc.) and the kind of request. The second part is a path that corresponds to the kind of request.

#### Examples

In the dojo we can ask Clay -- the Arvo filesystem -- for a listing of the files at our current path, `%`:

```
> .^(arch %cy %)
[ fil=~
    dir
  { [p=~.app q=~]
    [p=~.sur q=~]
    [p=~.gen q=~]
    [p=~.lib q=~]
    [p=~.mar q=~]
    [p=~.ted q=~]
    [p=~.desk q=~]
    [p=~.sys q=~]
  }
]
```

The `%c` is for Clay, and the `y` is for the request type. `arch` is the type of the listing. See `gen/cat.hoon` to see how this information is printed more prettily.

The `%` is for the current path in the dojo:

```
> `path`%
/~zod/base/~2018.9.20..23.05.35..0231
```

You can modify the time of the file listing quite simply and ask for a listing from 5 hours ago. (Remember that Clay is a revision-controlled file system.)

```
> .^(arch %cy /(scot %p our)/base/(scot %da (sub now ~h5)))
[ fil=~
    dir
  { [p=~.app q=~]
    [p=~.sur q=~]
    [p=~.gen q=~]
    [p=~.lib q=~]
    [p=~.mar q=~]
    [p=~.ted q=~]
    [p=~.desk q=~]
    [p=~.sys q=~]
  }
]
```

`our` is the value for your ship's name.

## `.+` "dotlus"

Increment an atom with Nock `4`.

#### Syntax

One argument, fixed.

{% table %}

- Form
- Syntax

---

- Tall
- ```hoon
  .+  p
  ```

---

- Wide
- ```hoon
  .+(p)
  ```

---

- Irregular
- ```hoon
    +(p)
  ```
{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%dtls p=hoon]
```

#### Produces

`p` plus `1` if `p` is an atom; otherwise, crashes. The product atom has no aura.

#### Examples

```
> .+(6)
7

> +(6)
7

> +(%foo)
7.303.015

> +([1 2])
nest-fail
```

## `.*` "dottar"

Evaluate with Nock `2`.

#### Produces

Nock of formula `q` and subject `p`, with type `%noun`.

#### Syntax

Two arguments, fixed.

{% table %}

- Form
- Syntax

---

- Tall
- ```hoon
  .*  p
  q
  ```

---

- Wide
- ```hoon
  .*(p q)
  ```

---

- Irregular
- None.
{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%dttr p=hoon q=hoon]
```

#### Discussion

`.*(p q)` is used to run Nock formula `q` on the subject `p` from within Hoon.

Keep in mind that `p` and `q` can be arbitrary Hoon expressions, as long as they evaluate to the appropriate nouns for Nock evaluation.

Note also that `.*` ("dottar") can be used to bypass the type system. It's
therefore possible to use Hoon as a typeless language.

#### Examples

```
> .*([20 30] [0 2])
20

> .*(33 [4 0 1])
34

> .*(|.(50) [9 2 0 1])
50

> .*(12 [7 [`1 [4 `1]] [`2 `3 `2]])
[12 13 12]

> .*(~ [5 1^4 [4 1^3]])
0

> .*(~ [5 1^5 [4 1^3]])
1
```

## `.=` "dottis"

Test for equality with Nock `5`.

#### Syntax

Two arguments, fixed.

{% table %}

- Form
- Syntax

---

- Tall
- ```hoon
  .=  p
  q
  ```

---

- Wide
- ```hoon
  .=(p q)
  ```

---

- Irregular
- ```hoon
    =(p q)
  ```
{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%dtts p=hoon q=hoon]
```

#### Produces

`%.y` if `p` equals `q`; otherwise `%.n`.

#### Discussion

Like Nock equality, `.=` ("dottis") tests whether two nouns are the same,
ignoring invisible pointer structure. Because in a conventional noun
implementation each noun has a lazy short hash, comparisons are fast unless the
hash needs to be computed, or we are comparing separate copies of identical
nouns. (Comparing large duplicates is a common cause of performance bugs.)

#### Examples

```
> .=(0 0)
%.y

> =(0 0)
%.y

> .=(1 2)
%.n

> =(1 2)
%.n

> =(12 [12 14])
%.n
```

## `.?` "dotwut"

Test for cell or atom with Nock `3`.

#### Syntax

One argument, fixed.

{% table %}

- Form
- Syntax

---

- Tall
- ```hoon
  .?  p
  ```

---

- Wide
- ```hoon
  .?(p)
  ```

---

- Irregular
- None.
{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%dtwt p=hoon]
```

#### Produces

`%.y` if `p` is a cell; otherwise `%.n`.

#### Examples

```
> .?(42)
%.n

> .?([42 43])
%.y
```
